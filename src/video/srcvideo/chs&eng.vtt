1
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.870
这一生犹如造物主奇异的杰作
How strange a work of providence is the life of man

2
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.850
这些年我流落荒岛摆脱困境已属无望
All my years upon this desolate island

3
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.040
摆脱困境已属无望
void of all hope of recovery

4
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.400
唯我独生船上同伴皆葬身海底
But I am alive and not drowned as all my ship's company was

5
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.130
我是鲁宾逊·克鲁索
I am Robinson Crusoe

6
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.320
放眼望去我如同身陷囹圄
Wherever about my prison I may look

7
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.380
但心中却仍是那片失落的乐园
In my mind's eye is the paradise I lost

8
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.890
我唯一的解脱是沉醉于回忆
My only escape is into the memory of a life

9
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.130
那似乎永远像个消逝的梦想
which seems ever more like a fading dream

10
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.570
我准备着那天的来临
This day finds me prepared

11
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.640
我对世界从未放弃过希望
I have never given upon the world

12
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.110
我相信上帝还未弃我而去
and I have faith that providence has not yet given up on me

13
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.620
一艘船
A ship

14
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.780
英国国旗
An English flag

15
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.360
Dundee 快来
Dundee come on

16
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.770
欢迎来到天堂
Welcome to paradise

17
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.250
大家自便
Make yourselves comfortable

18
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.550
嗨
Hey

19
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.650
那是什么
What's that

20
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.160
Judy 我们给你物色了一名夫婿
Hey Judy we found you a husband

21
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.530
臭哄哄的船难者想泡我的机会
A stinking castaway has got about as much chance as the rest of you

22
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.970
你认为是船难者
Castaway you reckon

23
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.560
假如他知道黄金呢
What if he knows about the gold

24
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.340
这里
Hey Here

25
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.170
我手无寸铁
I'm unarmed

26
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.710
我手无寸铁
I'm unarmed

27
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.210
别浪费弹药 距离太远了
Ah don't waste your powder not at this distance

28
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.520
去 抓住他
Go get him

29
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.320
我们去抓住他
Ah you lubber Let's get him

30
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.980
留下几个
Eli stay here

31
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.900
我们遇到了一个狡猾的家伙
We've a crafty one here then

32
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.410
我在这发现一个死人
Well I've got a dead one here

33
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.810
我们不能就这样罢手离开
Now we can't just leave it can we

34
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.400
看这作了记号 所以对他的陷阱了如指掌
Look at this He's blazed a trail so he'll know his own traps

35
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.940
如果你看到类似的记号 要务必小心
If you see another mark like this watch out

36
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.150
一 二 三 四 五 六
One two three four five six

37
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.210
嗨
Hey hey

38
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.440
在地狱里再待一会儿
Stuck in hell a little while longer

39
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.710
地狱或是男人该经历的地方
Hell is wherever a man happens to be

40
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.550
这会让他远离所爱之事与物
If it keeps him from what he loves

41
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.830
星期五想知道陷阱是哪种白痴制造
Friday wonders what kind of idiot builds all those traps

42
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.970
然后跑啊叫啊 手无寸铁地到海滩上去
then runs yelling to the beach without a weapon

43
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:43.270
你知道我去了海滩了
You knew I was at the beach

44
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.180
看到烽火我就猜到了
I could guess it from the beacons

45
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:46.810
既然那样的话
Well in that case crusoe wonders

46
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.720
为何知道星期五 不快速加入呢
why Friday didn'tjoin in sooner

47
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.120
我在欣赏白痴好戏呢
I was enjoying the idiot show

48
00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.420
你会选择开枪 还是把他们打倒
Do you shoot those or bring them down

49
00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:58.360
或是更加聪明的办法
with a well aimed shot of wit

50
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.800
弹无虚发
One bird one arrow

51
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.260
我知道 你是个天生的射手
I know One of nature's marksmen

52
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.460
这里有个天生的猎物
Says one of nature's targets

53
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.680
这里没人说英语吗
Hey hey does any one here speak English

54
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.120
我是英国人
I am English

55
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:25.820
那为何你用西班牙语咒骂
Then why do you curse in Spanish

56
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.520
在西班牙帆船上干了六年
Six years below decks  on a Spanish galleon

57
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:30.530
没什么事情可做
There's not much else to do

58
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.760
我对你不构成威胁但你却朝我开枪 为什么
I wasn't a threat to you but you fired on me Why

59
00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.000
我什么都不会说的
Do your worst I'll say nothing

60
00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.110
那看起来很痛啊
That looks painful

61
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.670
是啊
It is

62
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.610
但不致命 我将它拔出来吧
But not mortal I will pull it through

63
00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.310
我招 什么都招
I'll talk I'll tell you everything

64
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:01.320
这里这小岛上有探险家的黄金
There's There's a conquistador gold on the island

65
00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:04.760
我们有地图林奇(Lynch)认为你也在找那个
We got a map Lynch thought you might be after it too

66
00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.030
谁是Lynch 你们老大
Who's Lynch your leader

67
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.890
我们中没有老大
We don't have a leader

68
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:12.270
2死1伤
Two men dead one wounded

69
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.100
他安全回到海滩上
and he's back safe on the beach

70
00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.670
依我看他就是老大
That sounds like a leader to me

71
00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:19.900
你的船在哪
Where's your ship

72
00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.340
没有大船只有我们来的那个单桅帆船
No ship just thesloop we came in

73
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:25.780
谢谢你
Thank you

74
00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.420
不幸的是
Unfortunately

75
00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:32.820
星期五需要他的箭
Friday still needs his arrow

76
00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.240
星期五也可以穿外套
Friday could use a coat

77
00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:53.980
这位先生 很可惜不再需要外套了
This gentleman alas needs a coat no longer

78
00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.240
为什么他说话方式那么奇怪
Why doe she talk like that

79
00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.280
星期五需要这个星期五说过那个
"Friday needs this Friday says that"

80
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.010
他在取笑我 他知道我不能叫出他的真名
He's making fun of me He knows I can't pronounce his real name

81
00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:04.180
- 你应该揍他  -是啊 我会试试的
- You should beat him  - Yeah I'll try that

82
00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:05.350
为什么叫星期五呢
But why Friday

83
00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.820
我在星期五找到他的
The day of the week I found him

84
00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.820
于是想把他训练成仆人
I had this idea I was going to train him as a servant

85
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:10.550
至于他为什么一直跟着我我也不明白
Why he stuck with me I don't know

86
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.360
你不能和野人做朋友
You can't make a friend of a savage

87
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:16.530
那野人能懂12种不同语言
That savage can make himself understood in 12 different languages

88
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.830
学会英语只用了6个月
It took him six months to learn mine

89
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.940
我给他读了失乐园现在他能给我背诵
I've read him Paradise Lost and now he recites it back at me

90
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.130
但他自己不会读 对吧
So he can't read for himself then eh

91
00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:27.270
不会
No

92
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.470
是啊 野人
Yeah savages

93
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:32.340
哇
Ow

94
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:39.320
听着 2个人死了
Listen with two men dead

95
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:41.120
现在船上有空余位置
you'll have space on the boat now

96
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:42.890
你的脸皮真厚 一点不假
You've got a thick skin and no mistake

97
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.660
我的子女有危险
My children are in danger

98
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.130
我得回到英国去
and I need to get back to England

99
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.320
别和这些船员走很郑重的建议哦
Well not with this crew and that's serious advice

100
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.920
一旦找到黄金 人人安危难保
Soon as the gold's out the ground nobody's safe

101
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.700
短兵相接 没有后路可退你和你的星期五
Daggers drawn and don't turn your back you and your man Friday

102
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:55.070
我不想要你们的黄金
I don't want your gold

103
00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.570
你去跟那些西班牙渣子说好了
Explain that to the scum of the Spanish Main

104
00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.540
你会熬不过第一晚的
You'll not last the first night

105
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:03.980
那么我会这么做
Then here's what I'll do

106
00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.110
没人会干扰你们的任务
No one will interfere with your mission

107
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.690
你将看不到我们
You won't even see us

108
00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.890
但你得为我做件事
But do this one thing for me

109
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.430
当你回到陆地上
When you return to the mainland

110
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.190
告诉当权者这里有个岛
tell someone in authority that here is an island

111
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.830
小岛上有个落难已久的男人
and on it is a man who's desperate

112
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.030
迫切渴望回乡和心爱的人团聚
to get to his home and the ones he loves

113
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.170
你会那么做吗
Will you dot hat for me

114
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.340
这要求不算高吧
Surely that's not too much to ask

115
00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.180
20多年来没人尊重过我
No one's showed me respect in more than 20 years

116
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.050
我 那个曾要开枪杀你的家伙
Me who tried to shoot you down

117
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.660
嗯
Mmm

118
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.220
我喜欢好故事
I love a good story

119
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:58.060
我还发现我需要熟悉小岛的人
I also find I'm in need of a man with some local knowledge

120
00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:10.030
船长Lynch的手枪倒是不错
Those are some pretty fancy pistols our captain Lynch has there

121
00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.260
说不定他下岸就射不准了
Maybe he's all show and cannot shoot straight

122
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.130
你逃跑试试看 我们就知道准不准了
You run for it we' ll soon find out

123
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.400
呃
Aye

124
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:19.500
有什么要说的一起分享下啊
If you've got something to say why doesn't you share it

125
00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.640
你在海上做什么
What's your business in these waters

126
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.370
私掠船
Privateers

127
00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.340
隶属圣乔治
under the flag of St George

128
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:28.150
- 他们是海盗  - 嗯
- They're pirates  - Hmm

129
00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.150
我们更喜欢"寻宝人"这个称呼
Ah we prefer"gentlemen of fortune"

130
00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.380
都没有一艘大船
With no ship

131
00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:35.180
命运使然 天有不测风云
Aye thanks to the small dip in our fortune

132
00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.950
大船在甘达海岸因事而破损
at the guns of the Guarda costa

133
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.820
我们送去修理了
which we're hereto remedy

134
00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:41.920
快点 快 跟上
Hurry up Come on clear it

135
00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:13.620
女士们 先生们 鲁宾逊·克鲁索
Lady and gentlemen Mr Robinson Crusoe

136
00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.890
称这个小岛是监狱
calls this island a prison

137
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.490
不好意思
Sorry

138
00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:24.040
你只要告诉我们怎么去目的地就行了
You just show us how to get to where we need to be

139
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:28.910
我可不知道你们要去哪
Well I don't know where you need to be

140
00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:30.670
我们有地图
We have a map

141
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.280
谁做的
Who made this

142
00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.120
看就够了吧
Just look will you

143
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.760
不行 很抱歉 我帮不了你
It's no good I'm sorry I can't help you

144
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:56.460
告诉克鲁索 他不帮忙的话 会有什么后果
Show Mr Crusoe what'll happen if he doesn't help

145
00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.340
好吧 来吧
All right come on boy

146
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:00.700
等一下
Hold

147
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.650
太恐怖了
Strike me down

148
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.950
看起来解决掉一个了
Looks like that one sank

149
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:32.430
野人们怎样他们会游泳吗
How does it go with savages Do they swim

150
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:59.130
我可不是这么想的
That was not really what I had in mind

151
00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:01.590
但我也跟你说清楚了吧
But is my point made

152
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.570
我们看地图吧 好吧
Let's just look at the map all right

153
00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.480
看啊 这没有太多地标
See there's not many landmarks

154
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.050
是啊 老爷子
You Crimp

155
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:31.690
我告诉过你了
I told you the old man's mind was going

156
00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:33.760
那老男人心智日衰没能完成地图
He never got to finish it

157
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.340
这有一条河但没有山
There's a river but there's no mountains

158
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.230
我也不知道这是啥
And I have no idea what this is

159
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.570
那是我的痣啦
That's me mole

160
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:56.050
那些字是什么
What about the writing

161
00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:00.490
从杀人岩那
From the killing rocks

162
00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.590
从接吻岩石那直到顶峰
From the kissing rocks

163
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.860
用鹰的眼睛
to the highest peak

164
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:09.730
看到深之最深处
and from the eagle's eye to the deepest deep

165
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.630
那是什么意思
Now what couldthat mean

166
00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:16.440
我不知道
I have no idea

167
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.840
赶快走
Moving on

168
00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.250
这是我的建议
Here's what I suggest

169
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.920
你只要带我们要去的地方即可
You just take us where we need to go

170
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:33.480
因为我们一得到想要的就会离开
'cause the sooner we get what we want

171
00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.390
我可不能给你定心丸
the sooner we'll be gone

172
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.590
我可不能给你定心丸
Well I can't promise any miracles

173
00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:42.570
这个小岛上的许多地方我都没见过
See there's an awful lot of this island even I haven't seen

174
00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.590
是啊 别指望搭我们的顺风船了
Yeah well forget any thought of leaving with us

175
00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:48.570
这帮人不行
Not with this Crew

176
00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.940
很多事比困在荒岛更糟
There are worse things than being marooned

177
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.010
你明白吗
Do you understand

178
00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.750
桶里是啥啊
So what's in the barrels

179
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:07.120
炸药
Gunpowder

180
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:10.190
假如要把财宝从地下炸出来就会用到
in case we have to blast the treasure out of the ground

181
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.320
看起来很重啊
Looks heavy

182
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.730
是的
I suppose it is

183
00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.600
跟我讲讲 带你来这个岛的船呢
So tell me this ship that brought you to the island

184
00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.070
残骸在哪里
where's the wreck

185
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.160
别提了 暴风雨摧毁了它  什么东西也没留下
Forget it Storms broke it up There's nothing left you can plunder

186
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.870
真可怜
Ah pity

187
00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.110
在这之后会怎么对待我
So what happens to me after this

188
00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.670
我猜可能会有一些表达谢意的方式吧
I suppose we'll find some way to show our gratitude

189
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:31.010
带我去个友好的港口
Take me to a friendly port

190
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.280
或许吧
Maybe

191
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:35.010
算了 还是把我扔这吧
Forget it Just leave me alone

192
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:36.560
那是小意思
Well that's the least we can do

193
00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.960
我们尽量帮你一些
And we do try to do the least we can

194
00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.030
那么 你要带我们去哪
So where are you taking us

195
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.630
去我认识的岩石那
To some rocks I know

196
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.630
他们有几分像在接吻
They're sort of kissing

197
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.670
遗憾的是你得野重新物色个野人
Sorry about you'll have to get another

198
00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.200
跟我讲讲这个地图吧
Well tell meabout this map

199
00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.440
我爸爸做的
My father made it

200
00:19:58.510 --> 00:19:59.910
他在哪
And where is he

201
00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.380
死了
Dead

202
00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.840
他是个小偷也是个海盗
He was a thief and a pirate

203
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.710
听起来你很为他骄傲啊
You sound very proud of that

204
00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.020
除了这也没有可骄傲的了
He did nothing else to be proud of

205
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.420
我想你爸是个很正派的人吧
I expect yours was a decent man

206
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:13.120
是的 如果他还活着的话
And still is If he lives

207
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.690
父亲啊 无论你还活着还是死去
Our father whether you live or you die

208
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:24.630
你永远都在我身旁
you are never far away from me

209
00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:27.100
现在你必须很勇敢了 小Robin
You must be brave now young Robin

210
00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:29.410
是啊 父亲
Yes Father

211
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.100
我也得这样
As must I

212
00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.670
我们度过了很多美好的日子 对不对
We've had many a happy day have we not

213
00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.970
当不幸的日子来临
And when an unhappy day comes along

214
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:40.980
我经常挂在嘴边的话是
what do I always say

215
00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:44.460
我们必须从那些快乐时光中汲取力量
That we must draw strength from those better times

216
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.080
对的
That's right

217
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:50.790
为什么Blackthorn先生来这
Why is Mr Blackthorn here

218
00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.760
他是我们的好朋友
He's been a good friend to us

219
00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.300
今天我感觉需要一个朋友
and today I fear I will need one

220
00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.440
你永远有我啊
You've always got me

221
00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.140
是的 Robin
Yes Robin

222
00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:10.550
我一直都有你
I will always have you

223
00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.330
你进去过了吗
Have you been inside

224
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.260
没 还没有
No not yet

225
00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:31.130
James 我想Robin该呆在外面
James I think Robin ought to stay out here

226
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:34.770
有因即有果
As to the events that led to

227
00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.170
使我沦落于此荒岛的种种事件
My circumstance on the island

228
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.870
今日想来 便是始于 那一天
I now believe that they began on that day

229
00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:12.310
接吻石
Kissing rocks

230
00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:14.740
觉得如何
What do you think

231
00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.180
现在怎样
Now what

232
00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:23.250
从接吻岩石那直到顶峰
Well from the kissing rocks to the highest peak

233
00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:28.120
这岛上最高的山是哪座
What's the highest mountain on this island

234
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.420
那就应该是我们从这里看到的最高的山
Well that's got to be the highest mountain that we can see from here

235
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.690
对
Yeah

236
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:36.530
觉得不对就纠正我
Correct me if I'm wrong

237
00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.830
不过我觉得应该是那边那座
but I'd say it's that one right there

238
00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:48.310
别看着我 不是我写的
Well don't look at me I didn't write it

239
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.370
唉
Oi

240
00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.840
快追 你这个懒鬼 快呀
Well get after him you lazy sods Move

241
00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.170
是我的话会更小心的
Ah I would be more careful

242
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.930
你知道这玩意会伤人的
You should see the damage one of those could do

243
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:47.400
我以为你知道呢
I take it you have

244
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:57.040
拜托 我们不能我们不能谈谈吗
Please can we can we just talk about this

245
00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:01.310
谈什么呢我警告过你别跑
What's to talk about I warned you not to run

246
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:02.950
给他支剑
Somebody give him a sword

247
00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.850
请别逼我和个女人斗
Please don't make me fight a woman

248
00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.090
给她一顿痛扁 Crusoe
Give her a good old drubbing Crusoe

249
00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.890
就当是我的私人请求
I'd consider that a personal favor

250
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:13.200
我要警告你 在我的家乡
I should warn you where I come from

251
00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:15.170
剑被看作是每个年轻绅士的武器
the sword is considered the weapon of every young gentleman

252
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:18.570
在我的家乡 我们不像年轻绅士那样打斗
Where I come from we don't fight like young gentlemen

253
00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.900
这样吧 如果你打败了Judy
I tell you what if you get past Judy

254
00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:23.460
怎样 你会我猜猜 你会放我走
What You’ll Let me guess you'll let me go

255
00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:24.600
我不相信你
I don't believe you

256
00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.740
100码起步 有额外奖励给抓到你的那个人
A 100-yard start with an extra share for the man that catches ya

257
00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.370
也就是我
and that'll be me

258
00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:33.250
不 我们停下来吧
No Let's stop this eh

259
00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:34.650
怎么了 Crusoe先生
What's the matter Mr Crusoe

260
00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.880
我以为这是个值得一搏的机会
I thought that's a sporting Chance

261
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.120
如果他没有打败我 额外奖励就是我的了
If he doesn't get past me the extra share is mine

262
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:41.250
停下
Stop this

263
00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:43.300
你能把它从我手上击落吗
Can you knock it out of my hand

264
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.530
能吗
Can you

265
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.410
加油 Judy
Come on Judy

266
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:28.100
加油啊
Come on

267
00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:34.170
别急 Judy 别急
Easy Judy easy

268
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.660
有人落水了
Man overboard

269
00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.040
这是干什么
What was that for

270
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:06.840
永远别帮我
Never help me

271
00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.250
你应该谢谢他
You should thank him

272
00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.790
为什么
What for

273
00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:16.580
她本要杀了你的
She'd have killed you

274
00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.450
不 我不这么认为
No I don't think so

275
00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.020
金子还是没有金子
Gold or no gold

276
00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:25.050
你看看她那时候的脸 那是死神的脸
when you see that face on her that's the face of death that is

277
00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.900
我见过死神的脸
I have seen the face of death

278
00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:35.670
当我还是孩童之时 生活充满战火和瘟疫
When I was a child we lived through fire and plague

279
00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.970
但从来没有任何的苦难
But no trial I have ever faced then or now

280
00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:42.070
有如我父亲那一天所经历的那样艰难
was as hard as the one my father had to face that day

281
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:32.890
很多
So many

282
00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:37.260
溺死河中的人都被带到这里
Anyone who drowns in the river they bring them here

283
00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:42.040
贫民 孤儿 自杀者
Paupers orphans suicides

284
00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.040
许多无人认领
Do many go unclaimed

285
00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.880
大部分 估计是
Most of them I imagine

286
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:58.520
女性30岁或以上眼球棕色
Woman 30 years or more

287
00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:01.960
浅肤色浅发色
eyes colored brown fair of skin and hair

288
00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.160
发现于莱姆豪斯河段
washed up at Limehouse Reach

289
00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.230
哦 上帝啊
Oh dear Lord

290
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:20.970
这个吗
Why this

291
00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:22.570
勇敢点 James
Courage James

292
00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.920
她告诉我她很幸福
She told me she was happy

293
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:31.620
我不知道对孩童来说哪个更难以接受
I don't know what's harder for a child

294
00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:35.150
母亲的死亡还是父亲的哭泣
to see your mother dead or your father cry

295
00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:02.320
那些可能有毒的
Those may not be safe to eat

296
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.260
我在西班牙的监狱里呆了16年
I've been 16 years in a Spanish prison

297
00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.470
我什么都能吃
I can eat anything

298
00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:12.700
16年
Sixteen years

299
00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:17.740
直到这群人出现 把我弄了出来
Till this bunch showed up busted me out

300
00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:21.110
他们想要的倒不是我
It wasn't me they wanted

301
00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:25.050
是这张地图 将其聚到了一起
It was this map she put 'em up to it

302
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:30.680
她说是她父亲画了这幅地图
She said her father drew the map

303
00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:35.950
在一个满是煤烟和生锈的钉子的臭烘烘的地牢里
In that stinking dungeon with soot and a rusty nail

304
00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.390
- 天啊  -是的
- Ouch  -Yeah

305
00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:42.130
他知道自己不行了 而他的秘密将消失
He knew his mind was going and his secret with him

306
00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:45.170
他花了两年时间
It took him two years

307
00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.400
一天天变得疯狂
getting madder every day

308
00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:50.840
所以在他完成小岛地图之前
So before he could finish mapping the island

309
00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:52.540
他意识不清了
His mind went

310
00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:56.170
他忘了我的名字
He forgot my name he forgot his own

311
00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:00.510
忘了自己的名字 又过了一年他才死去
It took him another year to die

312
00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.180
她几乎不认识他
She barely knew him

313
00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.960
但是他们说她很难过
But they say she took it hard

314
00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:31.080
他不奇怪吗
Isn't he strange

315
00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:33.780
自从他妈妈淹死以后 他一个字都没说过
He hasn't said a word since the day his mother drowned

316
00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:35.910
我不认为他奇怪
I don't think he's strange

317
00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.780
你不能让他开口的 我们都试过了
You'll not get him to speak We've all tried

318
00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.180
你好 你好
Hello hello

319
00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:44.230
看看当你示好的时候得到了什么
See what you get when you try to be friendly

320
00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:45.460
他叫什么名字
What's his name

321
00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:49.930
听起来有点外国的那种
It's one of those foreign-sounding ones

322
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.730
Krutznower
Krutznower

323
00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:55.100
你叫Crusoe 不是吗
It's Crusoe isn't it

324
00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:58.830
我听说你爸爸把名字改了
I heard that your father changed it

325
00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.410
但已经不能把它刻在墓碑上了
but it was too late to put it on the stone

326
00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:06.650
你叫Robinson Crusoe
You're Robinson Crusoe

327
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:10.080
我叫Susannah
My name's Susannah

328
00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.130
我妈妈也死了
My mother died too

329
00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:40.850
不会是那种玩意儿吧
Is that what I think it is

330
00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.580
不是 如果你觉得闻到了玫瑰香
Not if you think you can smell roses

331
00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:48.120
我会回到你身边的 Susannah
Susannah I will return to you Susannah

332
00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:52.360
不管他们怎么说 相信我 我会回去的
Whatever they may tell you believe that I will

333
00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.860
告诉我 Crusoe先生
So tell me Mr Crusoe

334
00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.170
岛屿的统治者
ye governor of all the island

335
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:03.970
我们已经从"接吻岩"到了"最高峰"
we've been from kissing rocks to highest peak

336
00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.540
不错
Lovely

337
00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:10.070
那么"鹰眼"和"深之最深处"又如何呢
How about eagle's eye and deepest deep now eh

338
00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.370
你不是要我去吧 是吗
You're not going to let me go are you

339
00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:15.890
你不知道
You don't know that

340
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:18.890
你一找到了金子 就会杀了我的
Once you find the gold you're going to kill me

341
00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:22.580
没那个必要
Not necessarily

342
00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:28.060
就是说我要相信突然的暴富
So I should believe that

343
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:31.100
会使你的仁慈之心大爆发
sudden riches will give you a burst in generosity

344
00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:35.570
更奇怪的事情也发生过 我的朋友
Stranger things have been known to happen my friend

345
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:41.270
那一定是你的鹰眼
That's got to be your eagle's eye

346
00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:46.510
确实是
So it is

347
00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:49.350
"鹰眼"
Oi eagle's eye

348
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.120
你的伤怎么样了 Tibbets
How's that wound Tibbetts you up to carrying on

349
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:24.680
准备好坚持了吗
You'll have to leave me

350
00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.850
我得让你来留下了
I'll only slow you down

351
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.520
继续前进
Moving on

352
00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:42.700
你在找什么
What are you looking for

353
00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:44.440
守护天使
A guardian angel

354
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:47.140
听我一句 没这么个东西
Take it from me there's no such thing

355
00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:52.150
那取决于谁在盯着你
That depends who's watching out for you

356
00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:32.690
现在怎么办
Now what

357
00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.090
你们呆在这 我看看水有多深
Well you stay here I'll see how deep it gets

358
00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.920
你到了对岸
Ah You get to the other side

359
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.790
就不在火枪射程内了
then you're gonna be out of musket range

360
00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.530
我不这么想
I don't think so

361
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:49.110
你 来做
You Do it

362
00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:50.560
为什么是我
Why me

363
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.510
因为你最臭
'cause you smell the worst

364
00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:53.640
去吧
Get on with it

365
00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:56.070
去吧 臭蛋
Yeah go on smelly

366
00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:01.720
我告诉过他别吃浆果
I told him not to eat the berries

367
00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.520
我觉得这是最深的地方了
I think this is about as deep as it gets

368
00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:12.850
走完再确定
Go all the way to be sure

369
00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:18.290
Crusoe先生 你是个会变通的小伙子
Mr Crusoe you being an adaptable fella

370
00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:21.960
怎么保持我们的火药干燥 有建议吗
any suggestions as to how we can go about keeping our powder dry

371
00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.880
有东西咬我
Something bit me

372
00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:27.310
咬回来
Well bite it back

373
00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.500
坚持
Carry on

374
00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:33.110
河里有什么啊
What's in the river

375
00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:37.020
我流血了
I'm bleeding

376
00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:38.890
可能是那个
There may be something

377
00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:42.460
- 蛇  -不是 没有蛇
- Snakes  -No No snakes

378
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:48.060
除非食人鱼漏掉了一条
Not unless the piranhas missed one

379
00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:03.040
你觉得这很有趣
Ye think that's funny

380
00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:04.310
我觉得
I do

381
00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.750
路途才过半 我们就损失了四个人
Half a day on this island and four men gone

382
00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:11.080
我该感到震惊吗
Am I supposed to be impressed

383
00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.950
- 我震惊了  -你能闭嘴吗
- I am  - Will you shut up

384
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:19.250
你认为我不会杀了你 因为我需要你
Now you think I won't kill you because I need ya

385
00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:20.820
那不会有什么意义 不是吗
Well that wouldn't make much sense would it

386
00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.560
不会可你有两个眼睛
No but you got two eyes

387
00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:28.330
像数手指头般玩弄 这有可能改变 我的朋友
and ten fingers and that may change my friend

388
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:30.500
听明白了吗
Am I understood

389
00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.200
听明白了吗
Am I understood

390
00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:38.680
是的
Yes

391
00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:44.420
现在
Now

392
00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:47.990
我们到底该怎么过去
how do we really get across

393
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:12.920
你实在有太多闲工夫了 我的朋友
You've had far too much time on your hands my friend

394
00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.150
这是没得选择的
It's not like it was out of Choice

395
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:37.970
哈
Hmm

396
00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.190
下一个谁
Who goes next

397
00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.290
我
I do

398
00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.130
枪械该怎么处理
But what about the guns

399
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.670
你带上它们
You bring them

400
00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:06.070
不能事事都我做吧
I can't manage everything by myself

401
00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.440
那就往返两趟
Well make two trips

402
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:10.030
你个白痴
You idiot

403
00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.570
那个Judy 她有点恐怖哦
That Judy she's a bit formidable

404
00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.810
那你试试在监狱里出生
Well you should try being born in a prison

405
00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.070
我是指真的监狱
And I mean a real one

406
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:19.210
不是你的幻想小岛
not your fancy island here

407
00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.910
Leport 他幻想自己和她有机会
LaPorte he fancied his Chances with her

408
00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:24.080
谁是Leport
Who's LaPorte

409
00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.710
刚才被你喂鱼的那个
The one you just fed to the man-eating fish

410
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:27.590
非常感谢
thank you very much

411
00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.820
我们丢了船的前一天晚上
The night before we lost the ship

412
00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:31.830
他在她耳边说了点悄悄话
he whispered something in her ear

413
00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:33.590
她一只手把他按在地上
She pinned himdown with one hand

414
00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:36.360
另一只手差点把他的眼睛挖出来
Near ripped his eye out with the other

415
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:37.660
听起来好恐怖
That sounds grim

416
00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:38.860
对他 是的
Well for him yeah

417
00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:41.670
对我们剩下的人却非常有趣
It was very entertaining for the rest of us

418
00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.670
我告诉你点事
I'll tell you something

419
00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:46.680
我不会去做试图驯服她的男人
I wouldn't want to be the man who tries to tame her

420
00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:48.230
快点 Bagwell
Hurry upBagwell

421
00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:10.590
从接吻岩到最高峰
From the kissing rocks to the highest peak

422
00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.330
鹰眼所望之深渊
and the eagle's eye to the deepest deep

423
00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:18.140
这里 这里
Here Here

424
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:26.470
你不是个平凡的男人 Crusoe
You're an unusual man Crusoe

425
00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.190
与什么相比
Compared to what

426
00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:30.520
你也很会打斗
You fight well too

427
00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:32.520
只在必须的时候
Only when I have to

428
00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:34.350
更是个好情人
More of a lover eh

429
00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:36.950
你有女人吗
You got a woman

430
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.990
我有妻子
I have a wife

431
00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:43.300
当然了 她叫什么名字
Of course What's her name

432
00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:48.200
Susannah 而她叫我
Susannah And she calls me

433
00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:49.600
鲁宾逊
Robin

434
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:55.570
好了
All right

435
00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:00.780
鲁宾逊
Robinson

436
00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:12.100
出自韦斯特郡织工之手的蕾丝
Fine lace from west country weavers

437
00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:17.060
做这些赚来的钱可以买匹马
With the money I make from this I can buy a horse

438
00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:20.300
骑着它可以去买织布机
And with a horse I can ride out and buy straight from the loom

439
00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:22.900
用我从中赚的钱
With the money I make from that

440
00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:25.270
可以投入船运贸易中
I can buy an interest in a ship

441
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:28.080
五年后
And in five years' time

442
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:30.410
如果命运公平不出意外的话
if the fates play fair then you

443
00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.720
你就能成Crusoe帝国的女主人了
Could be mistress to the empire of Crusoe

444
00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.850
女主人
Mistress

445
00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:43.290
你知道我想娶你的
You know what my intentions are

446
00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:47.090
过来看看
Come and see this

447
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:54.130
怎么样
What do you think

448
00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:01.410
做我们的第一个家不错吧
Good enough for our first home

449
00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.070
Robin 你真是非同凡响
Oh Robin you're impossible

450
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:06.410
应该说是天才之极
Mmm I thought I was rather ingenious

451
00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.080
嗯 好吧
Mmm All right

452
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:10.620
为了添置点家具 我想把婚礼延后
I'm willing to postpone the wedding for want of some proper furniture

453
00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:12.250
还得找间房子
And a house to put it in

454
00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.420
慢慢来吧
Steady on

455
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:14.750
如果我爸爸看到这些
If my father saw this

456
00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:16.450
别说他会看低我
Don't say he'd think less of me

457
00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:18.390
我想他会的
I don't think he could

458
00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:25.630
如果他不让你嫁给我怎么办
What would I do if he ever took you away from me

459
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:29.700
可我只爱你一个
You know I've never loved anyone else

460
00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:31.570
嗯
Mmm

461
00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.110
你救了我的命
You saved my life

462
00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:35.740
没有
I did not

463
00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:47.150
没了我你可能不会那么幸福  但一定得活下去
You might not be so happy without me but I know you'd survive

464
00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:57.360
鲁宾逊
Robin

465
00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:18.680
箭无虚发
One bird one arrow

466
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:26.430
都趴下
Everybody down

467
00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.490
- 嗨  - 抱歉
- Hey  - Sorry sir

468
00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:40.170
野人 给我放下弓箭
Savage drop your bow

469
00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:41.510
武器装备扔下悬崖
Throw your weaponsover the cliff

470
00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:42.570
他不会说英语
He doesn't speak English

471
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:44.440
可我会说野人语
Yeah but I speak savage

472
00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:48.040
快扔下去
Throw them over the cliff throw them now

473
00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.280
快扔掉 不然封刀见血
Or you'll get to seethe color of Crusoe's blood

474
00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.720
把弓箭扔下去
Throw your weapons over the cliff

475
00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:04.430
快
Throw them now Now

476
00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:09.760
走开
Now jump

477
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:20.810
我们看他掉下去的
We saw him fall

478
00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.610
怎么没死
Why isn't he dead

479
00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:26.550
没见他掉下去就看见他跳了
We didn't see him fall we only saw him jump

480
00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:30.050
你差点害死我
You nearly killed me

481
00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:34.020
他会跟着我们的
He's gonna keep on following us

482
00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.100
这样他就跟不了了
Not if we do this

483
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:54.140
那怎么回到船上去
How do we get back to the boat

484
00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:57.550
我相信天才·克鲁索 会有所发明的
I'm sure the ingenious Mr Crusoe will devise something for us

485
00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:00.020
对吧 Robin
Won't you Robin

486
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:08.250
嘘
Shh

487
00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:00.040
嗨
Oi

488
00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.660
人活得真累啊
A man grows weary

489
00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:52.890
我在西班牙从军了23年
I spent 23 years in the service of New Spain

490
00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:55.260
到头来落到这下场
and look at the bunch of dogs I end up with

491
00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:59.140
哦 别担心他们 没有一个是英国人
Oh don't worry about them not one of them English

492
00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:01.940
也不会用其母语交涉有用信息
nor any useful conversationin their own language

493
00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.300
我对你很好奇野人兄弟
You interest me savage

494
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:06.670
为何
Why

495
00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:11.150
你说那个鲁宾逊·克鲁索时候 像在说自己兄弟
You speak of this Robinson Crusoe like he's a brother

496
00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:13.850
那些海盗带着地图来的
Those pirates came herewith a purpose

497
00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.010
如果你能保证Crusoe的安全
If you can guarantee me Crusoe's safety

498
00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:18.150
我就告诉你他们要找什么
I will tell you what they're looking for

499
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:20.920
这岛上没金子的
Oh there's no gold on this island

500
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:23.990
30年前我们军队曾到访过
Our army went over it30 years ago

501
00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:26.190
如果有 也是以前的事了
If there ever was any it's long gone

502
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:28.260
他们以为他会带路去找宝藏
Well they think he's guiding them to it

503
00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:31.670
只有这样他才能保住
Then that's the only thing that's keeping him alive

504
00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.740
我们得涉水过去了
I think we are aboutto get our feet wet

505
00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:39.110
哦 不
Oh no

506
00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.270
不 最好别涉水
Not the best of ideas

507
00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:43.340
河里有很多寄生虫
The river is infested

508
00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:46.310
你们得搭个木筏
Your men will have to build a raft

509
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:50.690
叫他们来搭木筏  有点天方夜谭
Build a raft These men they wouldn't know how

510
00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:56.020
他是队中最出色的 可都能被椰子砸晕
That one came second in a fight with a coconut tree and he's the best of them

511
00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:01.670
叫他们听我的 我会告诉他们怎么做
Order your men to obey me I will tell them what to do

512
00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:05.940
如此甚好
This will be good

513
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:31.130
Crusoe先生 惊喜连连啊
So Mr Crusoe so full of surprises

514
00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:34.790
这岛上还有其他人吗
Is there anyone else on this island

515
00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.260
没了
Nobody

516
00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:39.860
那野人呢 还有其他野人吗
What about your savage Anymore like him

517
00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:41.640
他不是什么野人
He's not a savage

518
00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:44.580
那是什么
Explain him then

519
00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:46.640
他教我如何重新活下去
He's the man that taught me how to live again

520
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:49.910
呃 肯定是孤独透了吧
Ooh That must have been some powerful solitude

521
00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:51.880
你们怎么认识的
How did you two meet

522
00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:33.760
能休息下吗 就一会儿
Can we stop just for a minute Only a minute

523
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:37.520
累死可不值得
It's not worth skinning a person for

524
00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:45.370
走
Let's go

525
00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:58.350
如果要投票定你生死 不管是否值得 我会选择让你活着
For what it's worth if it came to a vote I'd let you live

526
00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:01.280
就因为你前面差点打败了我
Just 'cause you nearly beat me in a fight

527
00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.620
我这是示爱
Where I come from that counts as courtship

528
00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:05.920
我说过我是有妇之夫
I told you I'm a married man

529
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:08.550
那打输是我的习惯了
Well then losing fights should be second nature

530
00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:11.990
你真是在监狱里出生的
Is it true you were born in a prison

531
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:14.960
我倒希望是
I might as well have been

532
00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.070
克鲁索先生
Mr Crusoe

533
00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:20.660
别让他等着
Don't keep him waiting

534
00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:27.710
这岛上有几条河
How many rivers are thereon this island

535
00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:31.450
我是个漂流者 可不是调查者
I'm a cast a way not a surveyor

536
00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:35.780
岛末端的河是由西往东流的
The last river was flowing from left to right

537
00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:38.720
可这条这由东往西的
This one's flowing from right to left

538
00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:41.160
这怎么解释
How do you explain that

539
00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:44.220
是同一条河 就是中间有个大弯流
It's the same river with a very big bend in it

540
00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.820
想听听另一种解释吗
You want to hear another explanation

541
00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:53.340
假设向导先生在骗我们呢
Suppose our guide was deceiving us

542
00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:56.430
假设他知道宝藏所在的位置
Suppose he worked out the actual location of the treasure

543
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:59.450
又要隐瞒不说 所以带着我们兜圈子呢
and was keeping it to himself while leading the rest of us

544
00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:02.810
你不觉得我的解释更说得通吗
around in one big Circle

545
00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:05.810
你不觉得我的解释更说得通吗
Don't you think my explanation's better

546
00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:07.250
- 不  - 未必
- No  - I do

547
00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:11.350
既然如此 那怎么解释太阳在那边
In that case can you explain to me why the sun is over there

548
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:15.160
按我这个老水手的经验看 应该在那边啊
when by this old sailor's reckoningit should be over there

549
00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:18.030
因为你认错方向了
Because your reckoning is wrong

550
00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:22.130
我已经受够了
I've had enough of this you know

551
00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:26.770
我要马上杀了你
I think I'm gonna kill you right now

552
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:31.540
杀了我 就能证明你是个傻瓜
You go ahead and do that and I'll die knowing what a fool you are

553
00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:36.080
来啊
Do it

554
00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.840
我也受够了
I'm tired of you

555
00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:44.380
不管我帮没帮到你们 你最后都会杀了我
You've no intention of letting me live whether I help you or not

556
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:47.120
你还不知道自己在哪吗
Can't you see where you are

557
00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:50.690
朝周围看看
Look around you

558
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:55.730
我们正在鹰眼处 正中间
We're in the eagle's eye right in the middle of it

559
00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:01.370
离这两英里处 这条河流向无底瀑布
And this river two miles from here it falls into a bottomless pool

560
00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.740
深不见底
The deepest deep

561
00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:06.680
杀了我
So shoot me

562
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:11.080
你就自己去找吧
and go and find it on your own

563
00:52:19.090 --> 00:52:20.620
Crusoe先生
Mr Crusoe

564
00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.420
请您帮忙带路好吗
would you kindly lead the way

565
00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:28.530
好的
I will

566
00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:34.000
要是谁能帮忙搬火药
If somebody else will kindly carry the powder

567
00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:46.550
我爸爸一队人在去西班牙的路上掳获黄金
My father's Crew captured the gold on his way to Spain

568
00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:50.060
然后铸成炮弹的形状投运回家
and they cast it in the shape of a cannon to smuggle it home

569
00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:53.180
据说得到被抓捕的消息前 即将黄金掩埋
Legend has it that they buried it when they knew they'd be caught

570
00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.190
并发誓不得泄露埋葬位置
and they all took a vow not to reveal where

571
00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:57.960
但你爸爸还是泄露了
But your father broke it

572
00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:00.360
是在其他队员死后说出来的
Not while the others were alive

573
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:04.970
统治者想用美人计骗他说出秘密
The Governor even sent a woman to romance the story out of him

574
00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:10.110
所以我不是生在监狱里 是在那儿有了我
So you see I wasn't born ina prison I was just made in one

575
00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:12.270
朱迪
Judy

576
00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:16.610
钱啊 我们怎么办
Money eh What won't we do for it

577
00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:21.750
钱财对我来说曾是个问题
Money was a problem for me once upon a time

578
00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:25.090
Susannah的爸爸是伦敦最大的制桶商之一
Susannah's father owns one of London's largest cooperages

579
00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:28.620
他一定会用丰厚的嫁妆给女儿陪嫁
A man like that won't let his daughter go without a substantial dowry

580
00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:30.320
我不要他的钱
I don't want his money

581
00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:34.270
很公平 给你的穷爸爸
Fair enough Pass it on to your poor old father

582
00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:39.100
我要看着他的眼睛跟他说钱不是万能的
I want to be able to look him in the eyes and tell him that money never came into it

583
00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:41.400
那样显得很高尚 Robinson
That's very noble Robinson

584
00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:44.570
自尊心可不能当饭吃
But you can't feed a new family on your pride

585
00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:47.010
我能跟Jeremiah谈谈你的事吗
If I speak to Jeremiah for you

586
00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:49.570
无法想象Blackthorn先生出借房子
I can't imagine Mr Blackthorn having a room to rent

587
00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:51.050
可以说是放贷
About a loan

588
00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:52.880
我不大熟悉他
I barely know him

589
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:55.480
他对你一直很上心
He's always take nan interest in you

590
00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:58.810
你妈妈死后 他还想领养你
When your mother died he wanted to adopt you

591
00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:01.920
你认为他现在会选择我吗
You think he'dad opt me now

592
00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:04.930
让我们严格地谈生意 好吗
Let's keep it strictly business shall we

593
00:54:19.850 --> 00:54:22.680
从鹰眼到深之最深处
From the eagle's eye to the deepest deep

594
00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:25.610
野人星期五
According to Friday the savage

595
00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:30.750
曾说过这瀑布深不见底
the pool at the end of this waterfall has no bottom

596
00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:32.620
那么
And

597
00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:34.760
继续什么
And what

598
00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:38.090
那么金制炮弹到底在哪
And so where be the golden cannon

599
00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:41.330
往后看
Look behind you

600
00:54:45.070 --> 00:54:46.060
Hmm
嗯

601
00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:52.740
跟上他
Get after him

602
00:54:52.810 --> 00:54:53.840
我很乐意
Love to

603
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:55.240
你先请
You first

604
00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:03.290
又来了
Oh calamity

605
00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:23.600
你没事吧
Are you all right

606
00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:31.680
放轻松
Easy Easy

607
00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:42.260
好
All right

608
00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:44.730
上面是谁
Who's up there

609
00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:46.660
西班牙狱卒
Spanish prison guards

610
00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:48.670
什么
What guards

611
00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:51.400
我带他们一路走来
I brought them across the piranha river

612
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:53.600
来得正是时候
And no complaints about my timing eh

613
00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:58.900
兄弟 谢谢你
Hey hey my brother thank you

614
00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:01.740
别客气
My pleasure

615
00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:04.470
走吧
Let's go

616
00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:22.200
她长得真迷人
She's a very striking-looking woman

617
00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:24.260
我也觉得
Can't say I noticed

618
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:27.530
再等她就走了
Any longer and she would have been all over you

619
00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:30.470
这就是克鲁索效应
It's the Crusoe effect

620
00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:32.940
我心中只有一个女人
You know there's only one woman in my life

621
00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:35.110
你现在可以回到她身边去了
And now you can go back to her

622
00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:37.010
他们要走了
Hey they are leaving the island

623
00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:38.850
我知道
I know

624
00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:43.010
他们不是狱卒 他们是西班牙的海岸卫队
Those aren't prison guards that's the Spanish Guarda Costa

625
00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:47.620
英国海军都是他们的敌人
They hunt down English mariners and lock them up

626
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:50.490
不到万不得已都别想依靠他们
They're the last people I can surrender to

627
00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:52.590
噢
Oh

628
00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:57.200
如果要在他们和这个岛之间选一个
If it's a Choice of them or this island

629
00:56:58.410 --> 00:57:02.070
我想我们还需要在岛上呆久一点
well I guess we gotta stay here a little while longer

630
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:11.340
终于传来一声柔和而庄重的呼吸声
At last a soft and solemn breathing sound

631
00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:14.750
有如浓郁的蒸馏香水的蒸汽般升起
rose like a steam of rich distilled perfumes

632
00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:20.990
飘散在空气中 在她意识到之前
and stole upon the air that even silence was took ere she was ware

633
00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:23.290
希望她能改变自己的本性
and wished she might deny her nature

634
00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:27.620
“再也不会像现在这样流离失所了
and be never more still to be so displaced

635
00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.700
我洗耳恭听
I was all ear

636
00:57:32.010 --> 00:57:36.500
也许死亡之肋骨可以创造出这样一个灵魂
and took in strains that might create a soul under the ribs of death

637
00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:45.350
对不起 Crusoe
I am sorry Crusoe

638
00:57:47.090 --> 00:57:48.350
为什么道歉
For what

639
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:51.180
让你失望了
Your disappointment

640
00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:55.520
还会有其他船经过
Well there'll be other ships

641
00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:58.930
我们还有机会
And other Chances

642
00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:24.580
我应该给你说明那些陷阱的
I should explain about the man traps

643
00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:26.890
你不需要这么做
You don't need to No

644
00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:28.860
你应该问我 哪个笨蛋会设下这么多的陷阱
You asked me what sort of an idiot

645
00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:31.590
然后却连武器也没带就跑到海滩上去
sets traps for invaders then goes running down to the beach without a weapon

646
00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:34.720
那些陷阱都是你早设好的
Those traps were not made for your kind Crusoe

647
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:36.330
为了防止我逃跑
They were for mine

648
00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.840
不是那样 拜托 Crusoe
That's not true Oh Crusoe come on

649
00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:41.100
你看到了英国国旗
You saw the English flag

650
00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:45.440
你就从来没有想过自己的同胞也可能会伤害你吗
You never thought for once you might have anything to fear from your own

651
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:46.500
我应该想到这点的
I should have known better

652
00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:48.880
你现在终于明白了
You know better now

653
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:51.580
人就是这样的
Men are just men

654
00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:52.910
相信我
Trust me

655
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:55.280
还有你的狗
Trust your dog

656
00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:58.050
不要相信其他人
But trust no one else

657
00:58:58.120 --> 00:58:59.220
不是每个人都会这样的
Everyone is not the same

658
00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:00.920
不 我们都是一样的 我的兄弟
Yes we are my brother

659
00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:03.160
我们会吃敌人的肉
My people eat the flesh of their enemies

660
00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:05.750
而你们会饮上帝的血
while your people drink the blood of their god

661
00:59:05.830 --> 00:59:08.270
你希望找到回家的路 我也想
You miss your people miss mine

662
00:59:08.330 --> 00:59:10.700
你想念你的家人我也想我的家人
You wish you could find your way home so do I

663
00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:17.040
唯一的区别就是我再也没有机会了
But the difference between us is that I know I never will

664
00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:19.840
什么意思
What do you mean

665
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:24.850
Crusoe你做梦都想回家 是吧
Crusoe you dream about going home yes

666
00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:26.820
对 但是我不能回去
Yes but I can't

667
00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:29.320
你救了我
You saved my life

668
00:59:29.790 --> 00:59:33.050
现在我的命就是你的了
And now I've pledged it to you

669
00:59:33.130 --> 00:59:36.390
我会一直跟随你左右
Where you go I go

670
00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:40.890
我从来没这么想过
Well that was never the idea

671
00:59:41.970 --> 00:59:44.660
该怎么说才对 我释放你了
What do I have to say I release you

672
00:59:46.170 --> 00:59:47.540
释放我
Release me

673
00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:51.740
你不能释放我
You cannot release me

674
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:54.910
我不是你的奴隶
I am not your slave

675
01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:09.690
对不起
I'm sorry

676
01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.990
恨不得那是我的头吧
Is that instead of my head

677
01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:22.370
严格来说 你还是食人族吧
Technically speaking you are still a cannibal right

678
01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:26.900
自从我们养羊之后我就再也没碰过人肉了
As long as there are goats on the island I will never again taste human flesh

679
01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:31.080
嗯 很高兴你变了
Well that's good to know

680
01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:35.350
那如果羊都死光了呢
What if the goats die

681
01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:36.680
那么
Then

682
01:00:37.890 --> 01:00:39.620
你可千万别睡着了
Do not fall asleep

683
01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:57.410
你的孩子会再见到他们父亲的
Your Children they will see their father again

684
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:59.210
我也深信这一点
I'm sure you're right

685
01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:02.880
他们也会见到星期五叔叔
And on that day they will meet their uncle Friday

686
01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:08.380
在那时 我就知道还有人在守护这他们
Well until that day I know that someone watches over them

687
01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.180
你们的神
Your god

688
01:01:12.090 --> 01:01:13.680
他们的教父
Their godfather

689
01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.990
你以前都叫我叔叔的
You used to call me uncle

690
01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.120
是吗
Did I

691
01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.360
对不起 忘了你已经不是个孩子了
Oh I'm sorry I was forgetting you're not a Child anymore

692
01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:24.960
没关系 我很快就要结婚啦
No sir I'm soon to be married

693
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:30.210
我知道 恭喜 你父亲告诉我 你需要一笔钱
Yes congratulations And your father tells me you need a loan

694
01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:34.240
是 不过我没想过这么快就直接跟你说这个事情
Yes sir although I hadn't planned to bring us quite so quickly to the point

695
01:01:34.310 --> 01:01:35.540
Robin 生命这么短暂
Well life is short Robin

696
01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:39.070
拐弯抹角就是在浪费生命
and time spent dancing around a subject is time wasted

697
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:41.650
你需要多少钱
How much do you need a thousand

698
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:44.210
一千就够了
A thousand would be

699
01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:46.120
我给你写张字条
I'll draw up a draft

700
01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:47.520
我会还给你的
Well I will repay you

701
01:01:47.590 --> 01:01:49.650
你给得出利息吗
Can you afford the Charge

702
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:54.370
那要看利息有多高了
That depends on what the Charge is

703
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:57.430
我一直想成为你的教父
I've always wanted to be a godfather

704
01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:00.970
真的吗
Really

705
01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:05.030
我排行第二 本来是无权继承的
Now I was a second son without prospect of a fortune

706
01:02:05.110 --> 01:02:08.480
但因我哥哥过世 才得到这一切
Then my brother died and everything passed to me

707
01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:10.070
但是如果我死了
But when I die

708
01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:12.280
你会有自己的继承人的
There's time yet for a son of your own

709
01:02:12.350 --> 01:02:15.150
对单身汉来说太难了
Oh difficult task for a bachelor

710
01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:20.280
我听闻坊言有个男人付钱让女人给其生娃
I heard a story once of a man who paid a woman to bear him a Child

711
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:24.360
不过那也只是个故事罢了
But it was just a story

712
01:03:12.550 --> 01:03:14.040
Dundee回来了
Dundee's back

713
01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:26.090
星期五
Friday

714
01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:28.850
终于找到他了
We found them

715
01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:28.120
他们为什么找到这里来
Why are they here

716
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:30.680
我想他们是猜我知道宝藏在哪里
They think I know where the gold is

717
01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:33.020
你真的知道
Do you

718
01:04:33.090 --> 01:04:34.860
Crusoe先生
Mr Crusoe

719
01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:42.260
他们举了个旗子
They've got a rag on a stick

720
01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:44.530
很好 白色的
Yeah Is it a white one

721
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:49.870
嗯 差不多
Uh More or less

722
01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:53.170
那是休战旗 先别开枪
Yeah it's the flag of truce Don't shoot first

723
01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:57.410
至今七年霉运不断
It's seven years bad luck or something

724
01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:01.210
不出来我要打死你的狗了
In your place Mr Crusoe I'll be shooting the dog

725
01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:05.590
别以为我没有考虑
Don't imagine I'm not considering it

726
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:11.290
我给Santanathe上尉看了纹身藏宝图
I showed captain Santana the tattoo

727
01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:14.160
发现我们其实有很多的共通点
now we find we have more in common than we thought

728
01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:16.390
虽然立场不同 利益是一致的
Different sides same game

729
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:19.600
分成还是不一样的
You know different levels of rewards

730
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:22.370
Santana上校和我达成了协议
So captain Santana and me

731
01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:25.840
我们目前有共同的兴趣
we've uh merged our interests

732
01:05:26.110 --> 01:05:30.170
现在需要你告诉我们宝藏的地点
All we need now is for you to tell us where to find our gold

733
01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:32.650
为什么你觉得我会知道
What makes you so sure I know

734
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:37.050
别在我面前说谎话 Crusoe先生 我可是说了一辈子的谎话
Don't try to lie to me Mr Crusoe I have been a liar all me life

735
01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.420
告诉你们宝藏的地点
Say I can give you what you want

736
01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:41.550
我们会有什么下场呢
What happens to us then

737
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:43.090
难说
I don't know

738
01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:44.920
你有什么要求
What would you believe

739
01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:50.030
尽管提
Make us an offer

740
01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:54.870
离开这个岛
Get off my island

741
01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:56.310
就这么简单
That's it

742
01:05:56.380 --> 01:06:01.370
我要杀了那个野人 然后放了你 相信我
I'll kill the savage and I'll take you alive and then believe me

743
01:06:01.450 --> 01:06:03.810
到时你说什么都可以
you will talk

744
01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:07.150
他们都是军人
These boys are the sons of the Inquisition

745
01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:09.520
我相信他们
I'd be inclined to believe him

746
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:14.720
谈判破裂 很抱歉
No deal Sorry

747
01:06:14.790 --> 01:06:18.130
那么你是向我们宣战了
So it's war then

748
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:22.160
开战吧
It's war

749
01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:25.460
我们要看住各个方向
We need to watch all sides

750
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:32.900
有什么问题吗
What

751
01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:35.110
- 你知道宝藏在哪里  - 大概吧
- You know where the gold is  - Maybe

752
01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:36.380
- Crusoe  -你要我怎么做
- Crusoe  - What if I do

753
01:06:36.450 --> 01:06:38.820
告诉他们 让他们找到宝藏然后离开
Then tell them Let them take it and go

754
01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.750
一旦他们找到宝藏我们就完蛋了
Once they get the gold we die

755
01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:42.120
他们现在是这么说
They say that now

756
01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:44.420
但只要找到宝藏他们必定内讧
but once they have got it they will not stick around and fight

757
01:06:44.490 --> 01:06:47.290
我也希望会是那样 听着
I wish it were that simple Look

758
01:06:47.790 --> 01:06:49.990
从亲吻石到最高点
From the kissing rocks to the highest peak

759
01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:52.900
从鹰眼滩到最深处
from the eagle's eye to the deepest deep

760
01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:00.400
我们就在宝藏上面
We're on top of it

761
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:02.670
我们不能坐着等死 得想个办法
We can't just sit tight We're in the way

762
01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:08.710
他们藏在树后面
They're in the trees

763
01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:10.810
他们上桥了
And on the bridge

764
01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:26.690
克鲁索
Crusoe

765
01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:30.690
怎么了
What's happening

766
01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:32.640
他们想把我们熏下去
They're trying to smoke us out

767
01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:44.980
只好用喝的水了
The drinking water

768
01:07:45.450 --> 01:07:49.320
理智点吧 Crusoe先生 我们也想给你留个活口
See sense Mr Crusoe We'd rather have you in one piece

769
01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:51.850
你死了就什么用处都没有了
You're of no use to anyone dead

770
01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.270
一旦点燃 很快就会爆炸的
When this goes it'll go fast

771
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:17.310
我已经准备好了
I am ready

772
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:56.250
比我想象的还快
That was a bit faster than I expected

773
01:08:59.790 --> 01:09:00.880
火药都湿了
My powder's wet

774
01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.190
我去取点过来
I will get some more

775
01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:03.560
星期五别去
No Friday

776
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:07.200
他回来了
He's back

777
01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:12.800
这显然不是个好主意
Definitely not the best of ideas

778
01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:23.610
他们的火药用完了 搬个火药桶过来
They're out of gunpowder get a keg

779
01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:26.010
你知道该怎么做吧
You See

780
01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:29.380
别让他们从桥上走过去
No let them walkover bridge

781
01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:30.480
那边
There

782
01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:33.850
取不到火药
I can not reach the powder

783
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:37.830
把他们炸出来
We'll blow them down

784
01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:45.230
放到树下面去
Set it at the base of the tree

785
01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:33.100
那艘船的名字叫“金色虚荣”
And the name of the ship was the Golden Vanity

786
01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:37.140
我们担心她会被西班牙敌人袭击
And we feared she would be taken by the Spanish enemy

787
01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:39.810
当她在低地航行时
As she sailed upon the lowland

788
01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:41.910
低地低地
Lowland lowland

789
01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:44.050
在低地航行
Sail upon the lowland

790
01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:45.380
他们一定是在想办法
They're planning something

791
01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.520
没错
Yes they are

792
01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:50.420
别紧张 只有我一个人
Stand easy I'm alone

793
01:11:50.730 --> 01:11:54.290
她能找到办法上来其他人也肯定可以
If she could find a way inhere the rest of them can

794
01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:59.130
我可不这么想 她跟他们不是一个等级
I wouldn't guarantee that This one's a ship of a different Class

795
01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:00.460
是Lynch让你过来的吗
Did Lynch send you

796
01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:02.340
不是 他没然我过来
No sir he did not

797
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:05.200
我是自己过来的
I'm here of my own account

798
01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.080
改变你的立场
To Change your colors

799
01:12:07.150 --> 01:12:08.880
支持处于劣势的一方
To the losing side

800
01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:13.080
我们认识的时间不长 Crusoe先生不过我想你还是了解我的
You haven't known me long Mr Crusoe but I think you know me better than that

801
01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:14.950
然后
What then

802
01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:19.190
我不喜欢看到一个好人无故死去
I hate to see a good man die for nothing

803
01:12:19.630 --> 01:12:21.920
放弃宝藏 我能保证你的活路
Give up the gold and I'll make sure you live

804
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:25.430
那肯定不会是Lynch的主意
That's definitely not what Lynch has in mind

805
01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.600
要改变一个人的想法枪是最有效的
Nothing Clears the mind like a musket ball passing through it

806
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.870
放弃吧 Crusoe
Oh come on Crusoe

807
01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:36.370
你活不过明天早上的
You won't last the morning there are only two of you

808
01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:39.670
你们只有两个人而且没有了火药
And you can't even reach your powder

809
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:46.420
你是打算要抗争到底了
You're going to fight

810
01:12:48.190 --> 01:12:49.420
恐怕也只能这样了
I'm afraid so

811
01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:51.720
真可惜 很公平
Pity It's a fair offer

812
01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:56.460
是 不过我们的公平明显是不一样的
Hmm Yes but you and I we have different ideas of what fair is

813
01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.730
但谢谢你的好心劝告
But thank you for the"good man" business

814
01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:00.160
我告诉你我会怎么做吧
I'll tell you what I'll do

815
01:13:00.230 --> 01:13:03.630
到时候我会杀了你们俩 迅速解决掉
When the time comes I'll kill you both myself and I'll make it quick

816
01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:05.830
你真好心
Very kind

817
01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:07.340
相信我
Oh trust me

818
01:13:07.410 --> 01:13:10.200
有个西班牙人做了很坏的计划
one of those Spaniards has some very grim plans for you

819
01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:13.240
啊 我能猜出是谁
Ah I can guess which one

820
01:13:14.610 --> 01:13:15.840
我用椰子砸了他的头
I brained him with coconuts

821
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:18.710
伤他自尊了 干得好
Hmm Respecting his dignity Good for you

822
01:13:22.050 --> 01:13:26.620
那再见了 Crusoe先生
Well then goodbye Mr Crusoe

823
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:28.960
晚安
Good night

824
01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.260
朱迪思·朱迪
Judith·Judy

825
01:13:37.170 --> 01:13:39.160
早上见
I'll see you in the morning

826
01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:42.130
低地低地
lowland lowland

827
01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:45.840
在低地海上航行
Sailed upon the lowland sea

828
01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:47.780
然后船舱男孩开口说话了
Then up spoke the cabin boy

829
01:13:47.850 --> 01:13:49.310
他无拘无束的畅说
And boldly out spoke he

830
01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:50.850
你看上去挺高兴啊
You seem very happy

831
01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:54.780
我已经在找乐子了 虽然不知道要从那开始
Ah I'm spending me gold already though I hardly know where to start

832
01:13:55.250 --> 01:13:57.480
推荐你先去学唱歌吧
May I suggest singing lessons

833
01:13:58.390 --> 01:14:01.420
作为一个即将暴富的穷大兵
For a dirt poor soldier who's suddenly gained some prospects

834
01:14:01.490 --> 01:14:03.260
你看上去不怎么高兴啊
you don't seem very Cheerful

835
01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:06.200
你还没拿出证据 说明Crusoe能找到宝藏
You have given me no proof that Mr Crusoe can show us the gold

836
01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:10.200
不过事已至此 搭档
And yet here we are partner

837
01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:12.030
我们不是搭档
We are not partners

838
01:14:12.970 --> 01:14:14.200
你什么意思
What do you mean by that

839
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:17.800
你要明白这一点 没金子 就没自由
You need to understand something no gold no freedom

840
01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:21.410
你不能事后把我们关进监狱
You can't drag us back to jail after this

841
01:14:21.550 --> 01:14:23.010
今天下午 我两个手下死了
I lost two men this afternoon

842
01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.640
你不在乎他们生死
You despise your men

843
01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.950
没错 也许如此
Oh yes that might be so

844
01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:29.720
但他们都身为人子
but every one of them is a mother's son

845
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:34.450
如果死了 我总要表示一下
If I send a man to die I need something to show for it

846
01:14:34.530 --> 01:14:36.930
你会拿到抚恤金的
You'll get your prize

847
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.690
无论如何 我会的
One way or another yes I will

848
01:14:39.770 --> 01:14:41.630
最好找到黄金 Lynch
Produce your gold Mr Lynch

849
01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:46.690
否则明天 将再度成为你的西班牙敌人
or by this time tomorrow I'll be once again your "Spanish enemy"

850
01:14:49.710 --> 01:14:51.470
你去哪了
Where have you been

851
01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:54.570
英国人是不会问的
An English man wouldn't ask

852
01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:56.370
真的吗
Really

853
01:15:10.930 --> 01:15:14.760
我保证我们都能会逃出去的
I promise you we'll get out of this all right Both of us

854
01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:16.030
我知道
I know

855
01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:23.840
西班牙船长说 黄金大炮是个传说
The Spanish captain said the golden cannon is a legend

856
01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:26.870
是真的吗
You don't say

857
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:33.410
如果自己都不相信 为什么要冒死追寻呢
If you don't even believe a thing exists why risk your life for it

858
01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:36.790
他们没你看得淡
That's gold for you

859
01:15:42.490 --> 01:15:44.490
他们来了 快走
Here they come Go Go

860
01:15:58.410 --> 01:16:00.240
- 那是什么  -靠 是投石机
- What is that  -Oh it's a trebuchet

861
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:02.900
什么玩意
A what

862
01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:04.380
一种大型弹弓
A type of catapult

863
01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.050
你应该逃走
You should go

864
01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:16.690
我来吸引他们 你顺着绳子下去 然后逃走
I'II   I'll distract them You climb down a rope and go

865
01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:19.200
然后呢
Uh-huh Then what

866
01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:20.420
我不知道 我会想出办法的
I don't know I'll work something out

867
01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:21.560
他们会杀了你的 Crusoe
They will kill you Crusoe

868
01:16:21.630 --> 01:16:22.620
也许不会
Well maybe not

869
01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:24.000
也许暂时不会 但你也说了
Maybe not right away

870
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:27.300
如果发现岛上有黄金 他们就会杀了你
but you said it yourself if there's gold on this island they will kill you

871
01:16:27.370 --> 01:16:31.600
如果没找到他们会慢慢折磨你 以免你隐瞒
If there's no gold they will kill you slowly in case you're holding back

872
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:33.940
无论如何 他们都没必要追杀你啊
Either way there's no need for them to come after you

873
01:16:34.010 --> 01:16:35.600
别想了 Crusoe 拜托
Ah forget it Crusoe Come on

874
01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:06.140
跟我来
Come with me

跟我来

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.710
没事的
It's all right

877
01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:19.860
我叫克鲁索 鲁宾逊·克鲁索

他们开始攻击我们了
They're sighting in on us

885
01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:53.920
举起来快点

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:04.800
非常不妙
Very bad

888
01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.800
看似如此
Yeah Okay

889
01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:12.140
准备好了吗
Ready

890
01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:15.470
火药怎么样了

01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:17.520
应该干了
It might be dry by now

还是很潮
Still damp

893
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:25.820
我们需要干燥的火药粒
We need some dry grains

894
01:18:25.890 --> 01:18:27.360
- 那还要一会  -不行
- Well it will take a while before  - No

895
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:28.480
为何
Why

896
01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:30.550
因为我们马上就要被炸下去了
Because we're about to get blown out of the tree

897
01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:32.760
我来做 你看好他们

第二发就差不多了

904
01:19:01.730 --> 01:19:03.630
没管用啊 Lynch

我要些火热的东西 引爆炸药
I need something red hot to set off the powder

909
01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:20.240
用步枪子弹呢
Uh Not a musket ball

910
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:22.210
不行 步枪子弹是用铅做的 会融化的
No a musket ball is made from lead It'll melt

911
01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:23.370

01:20:00.190 --> 01:20:01.450
炸药桶装好了

921
01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:02.680

继续烧
Trying again

927

Crusoe 来了
Crusoe it's coming

928
01:21:10.690 --> 01:21:14.490
轻而易举啊 炸出来的洞
That's handy It's blown a hole to bury them in

929
01:21:22.370 --> 01:21:24.100
够埋他们的了
Strike me down

930
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:27.070
杀了我吧
Will you look at that

931
01:21:29.410 --> 01:21:30.810
你看看
We're rich

932
01:21:31.710 --> 01:21:34.700
我们发财了
Well I cannot say your gold impresses me much

933
01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:40.950
这些金子对我来说算不上什么
What's there could buy us a whole fleet of ships

934
01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:44.050
这够买一支舰队了 乌木甲板 丝绸风帆
with ebony decks and silken sails

935
01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:47.280
好吧 他们驶来之后 记得通知我
Fine Let me know when they get here

936
01:21:49.390 --> 01:21:50.490
等等
Wait

937
01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:54.220
这就说明 有艘空船了
This should mean there's a boat going spare

938
01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:56.270
那你最好快点
Well you better be quick

939
01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:57.600
为什么
Why

940
01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:01.400
你点点人数 还有人活着
Count the bodies Not everyone is here

941
01:22:12.150 --> 01:22:16.180
站住 除非你想入伙
Stop Unless you wish to join your countrymen

942
01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:21.860
我不是来跟你争斗的
We're not hereto fight you

943
01:22:21.930 --> 01:22:23.620
他放弃宝藏了
He's given upon the gold

944
01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:25.690
我可不愿意丧身于此
I'm not prepared to die for a legend

945
01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.960
他要送你入狱了
So he's taking you to prison

946
01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:39.570
克鲁索效应
The Crusoe effect

947
01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:46.780
往后站
Stand back

948
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:48.980
祝你好运
I wish you better

949
01:22:49.050 --> 01:22:51.720
你也是 Crusoe
You do Crusoe

950
01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:00.790
我可以杀了你 Crusoe
I could kill you Crusoe

951
01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:05.400
我可以杀了你们俩
I could kill you both

952
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:09.000
这就意味着 你现在该离开
But knowing what it would mean for you to leave

953
01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:11.470
我想者会让我更加开心
it will entertain me more to remember

954
01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:13.240
把你留在鸟不拉屎的地方
where I left you to rot

955
01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:18.110
别动
Stay

956
01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:22.820
别动
Stay

957
01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:55.450
克鲁索
Crusoe

958
01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:57.010
Dundee回来了
Dundee's back

959
01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:01.150
嘿 到这里来
Hey come here come here Come on

960
01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:05.190
这里 快点
Hey hey

961
01:24:11.770 --> 01:24:13.740
金子怎么办
What about the gold

962
01:24:13.810 --> 01:24:15.030
埋起来
Bury it

963
01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:19.940
Why为什么
Why

964
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:22.750
它被诅咒了
It's Cursed

965
01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:29.290
那埋起来是不管用的
Then burying it will not help

966
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:46.600
我的财富在远方 我的目标已明朗
My fortune lies elsewhere and my purpose is clear

967
01:24:47.410 --> 01:24:51.770
一个男人矗立在孤岛上
Here there is an island and on it is a man who is sick with desire

968
01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:55.510
他只想重返家乡 回到爱人身旁
to return to his home and the ones that he loves
